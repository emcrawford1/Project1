# PlanIt
Plan an event and choose a restaurant - all with the help of friends. This quasi-social media app will help you plan events with friends - seeing their invitation status in real-time.

## Technologies used
1. Firebase - to handle authentication, store user profiles, and manage events
2. Yelp API - to get list of restaurants while creating an event
3. Google Maps API - see the location on a map and get directions
4. Bulma - CSS framework structures and stylizes the application
